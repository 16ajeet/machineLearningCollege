Given two vectors:
x = [2, 3, 5, 7,5,6,3,1,19,11,12,16,15,5,2,1,7,2,4,5,6,12,11,2,3]

1. Write a function minkowski_distance(x, y, p) that calculates the Minkowski distance of order p.
2. Using this function, calculate the following distances between  x and y :
L1 distance (p=1)
L2 distance (p=2)
L3 distance (p=3)
3. Print the results with appropriateÂ labels.
