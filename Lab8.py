# Question 1 — K-Modes Clustering on a Categorical Dataset

# Dataset: Adult Income Dataset (adult.csv)

# Task:
# Apply K-Modes clustering to group individuals based on categorical socioeconomic attributes.

# 	1.	Import the Adult Income dataset and preprocess it by:
# 	•	Selecting categorical features such as workclass, education, marital-status, and occupation.
# 	2.	Use the K-Modes algorithm to cluster the dataset.
# 	3.	Determine the optimal number of clusters using the cost function plot. 


# Question 2 — Bisecting K-Means on a Numerical Dataset

# Dataset: Mall Customers Dataset (mall_customers.csv)

# Task:
# Apply Bisecting K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending behavior.

# 	1.	Import the dataset and standardize numerical features such as Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1–100).
# 	2.	Perform clustering using Bisecting K-Means.
# 	3.	Compare the results with traditional K-Means using:
# 	•	Silhouette score
# 	4.	Visualize both clustering results using 2D scatter plots.
